## Coversion from 3D Space coordinate to 2D Image Coordinate

Let us consider (X,Y,Z) are the 3D Space coordinates and fx, fy are the focal lengths of Kinect V2.

### Formula: 

```
Color Space Coordinates:
u = (X*fx /Z) + Cx
v = (Y*fy /Z) + Cy
where (X,Y,Z) are the Camera Coordinates and fx, fy are the focal lengths.
```

In our case:
```
Principal point (Cx, Cy) = (989.3053162, 555.9211734) and focal length fx = 1045.640667, fy = -1073.818121
```
#### To run this code:

  The input file format contains, a csv file with 3D coordinates. Once the input format is achieved, run the code below to get csv file with 2D image coordinates.
  
  

```
python conversion.py --input input.csv --output output.csv
```
